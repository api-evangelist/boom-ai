description: Use when the user wants to build, design, review, debug, or understand a Boom journey — the workflow graph behind an initiative that controls which template is sent, how long to wait, when the AI converses, follow-up rounds, branching by customer attributes, calling an external endpoint, or scheduling. Triggers on "build a journey", "follow-up rounds", "workflow", "why didn't the second message send", "branch by plan/attribute", "call our API from the journey", "re-engage after timeout".

# Design a Journey

A journey is the versioned workflow graph that runs each participant through an initiative: nodes emit **signals**, edges route on them. You can author a journey end-to-end through the MCP — create a draft, add and connect nodes, set the trigger, validate, and publish — or review and debug an existing one. Journeys can also be edited in Boom's visual builder; the MCP and the builder operate on the same graph, so you can hand off in either direction.

Your job with this skill: *build or debug the graph precisely*, then either publish it or give the user an exact node-by-node spec they can finish in the builder.

## Tools used

| Tool | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `journeys_list` / `journeys_get` / `journeys_get_definition` | Read a journey's versions and its full node + edge definition | read |
| `journeys_authoring_catalog` | The machine-readable node-kind catalog (kinds, inputs, output signals) — read this before building | read |
| `journeys_condition_catalog` / `journeys_event_catalog` | Valid DECISION predicate terms and dispatchable/reserved event names | read |
| `journeys_message_channels` / `journeys_message_templates` | Sending channel ids and approved template ids for SEND_MESSAGE | read |
| `journeys_message_variables` | The exact variable paths a SEND_MESSAGE template binding can reference for a journey (`customer.*`, `person.<key>`, and run-produced values) — read this before binding placeholders | read |
| `journeys_create_draft` / `journeys_create_draft_from_published` | Start a new editable draft (blank or copied from the live version) | write |
| `journeys_add_node` / `journeys_update_node` / `journeys_delete_node` | Add, edit, or remove a node | write |
| `journeys_connect_nodes` / `journeys_disconnect_nodes` | Wire (or unwire) an edge on a specific signal handle | write |
| `journeys_set_trigger` | Set how people enter (manual / segment / cdp_event); segment triggers can't be wired from here, see step 4 below | write |
| `journeys_update_draft` | Replace the whole draft definition at once | write |
| `journeys_validate` | Check a draft against the publish rules without going live | read |
| `journeys_publish` | Publish the draft — **this goes live to real customers**; confirm first | write |
| `initiatives_get` | The initiative the journey belongs to | read |

Tool names follow `domain_action`; if a call fails with `tool_not_found`, list available tools and match by that pattern.

## Node kinds and the signals they emit

| Kind | Group | Purpose | Key inputs | Emits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ENTRY` | trigger | How people enroll | `triggerType: manual \| segment \| cdp_event`; `segmentId` / `eventName`; optional frequency cap `maxEnrollments` + `enrollmentWindow` | `SENT` |
| `SEND_MESSAGE` | action | Send a WhatsApp template | `templateId` **and** `channelId` (both required to publish), `templateBindings` (see "Bind your variables") | `SENT` |
| `WAIT_FOR_REPLY` | action | Passive wait for the first reply (no AI) | `maxTimeout` | `REPLIED`, `TIMEOUT` |
| `MANAGE_CONVERSATION` | action | The AI-led conversation | `mode: AGENT \| ESCALATE`, optional `inactivityTimeout` (`1h`–`24h`) | `CLOSED`, `STALE`, + `INACTIVE` (only when `inactivityTimeout` is set) |
| `CONVERSATION_BLOCK` | action | **Legacy** combined wait + AI conversation | `mode`, `maxTimeout`, `goal` | `CLOSED`, `TIMEOUT`, `STALE` |
| `DELAY` | logic | Wait | `mode: duration` (`2d`) \| `until_date` (ISO instant) \| `until_weekday` (weekdays + time window + IANA timezone) | `SENT` |
| `DECISION` | logic | Two-way branch | `logic: AND \| OR` + conditions: person attribute predicate, event occurred, custom-object match, or a runtime value | `YES`, `NO` |
| `CASE` | logic | Multi-way switch on one person attribute (≤10 branches) | `selectionPath` + `branches[]`; a wired **default** is mandatory | `case:<branchId>` + `case:default` |
| `HTTP_REQUEST` | action | Call an external endpoint (your API / a webhook) | `method`, `url` (supports `{{variable}}`), `headers`, `body`, `credentialId`, `timeoutMs` (≤30s), `maxAttempts` (≤5) | `SUCCESS`, `FAILED` |
| `DISPATCH_EVENT` | action | Record a CDP event for the person | `eventName`, static or bound `properties` | `SENT` |
| `EXIT` | terminal | End the journey | optional `outcome` label; optional `nextInitiativeId` to chain into another initiative | — |

For new journeys, prefer **`WAIT_FOR_REPLY` + `MANAGE_CONVERSATION`** over the legacy `CONVERSATION_BLOCK` — the split gives you separate handles for "never replied" (`TIMEOUT`) vs "replied then the AI closed the conversation" (`CLOSED`), which most follow-up logic needs.

The visual builder also has an email-send node, outbound only with no reply of its own, that isn't in this table because it isn't in `journeys_authoring_catalog`: `journeys_add_node` can't create one. Build it in the app. There's also no email-template tool; `templates_create` / `templates_list` are WhatsApp only. A journey built with one in the app still runs and reads back fine here, and the one rule to know if you touch it: only a delay, an exit, or another non-conversational node may follow it, never a reply-driven one.

Routing rule: an edge fires when its `sourceHandle` equals the signal the node emitted. **Every signal a node can emit must have exactly one outgoing edge** — this is the #1 publish error.

## Authoring workflow (MCP)

1. **Learn the graph.** Call `journeys_authoring_catalog` for the node kinds and their inputs; `journeys_message_channels` / `journeys_message_templates` for the ids a SEND_MESSAGE needs; `journeys_message_variables` for the paths a template binding can reference; `journeys_condition_catalog` for DECISION predicate terms; `journeys_event_catalog` for valid event names.
2. **Open a draft.** `journeys_create_draft` for a blank one, or `journeys_create_draft_from_published` to iterate on the live version. Only a DRAFT is editable; a PUBLISHED version is frozen.
3. **Build the nodes.** `journeys_add_node` per node, `journeys_connect_nodes` per edge (name the `sourceHandle` — the signal the edge routes on). Positions are optional; the server auto-lays-out the graph.
4. **Set the trigger** with `journeys_set_trigger`. `manual` and `cdp_event` work fully from here. **`segment` does not**: it validates `segmentId` as the segment's internal id, and the public segment surface (`cdp-and-segments`) only exposes `slug`, so passing one fails `not_found`. Wire a segment trigger in the Boom app instead, everything else about the journey can still be built and published from here.
5. **Bind template variables** on every SEND_MESSAGE (see below), the most common thing to forget.
6. **Validate** with `journeys_validate` and fix every `error` (warnings are advisory).
7. **Publish** with `journeys_publish` once validation is clean. **Publishing starts real outreach, get explicit confirmation from the user first.** Publishing a new version supersedes the previous one; versions are immutable. This works on any journey, whatever its steps send, so you can take a whole flow live from here. One shortcut: if the initiative is set to the WhatsApp channel, `initiatives_launch` (see `launch-initiative`) publishes the current draft for you, so you can skip this call in that case.

You can also assemble the whole definition and send it in one `journeys_update_draft` call instead of node-by-node — useful when you already have the full graph designed.

## Bind your variables (the most common miss)

A SEND_MESSAGE references an approved template that has placeholders (`{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, a name, a link). The node will not fill them in unless you set **`templateBindings`** — a map from each template placeholder to the value it should carry (a participant attribute, or a value produced earlier in the flow). **Adding the SEND_MESSAGE node is not enough: set `templateBindings` for every placeholder in the template**, or the message sends with empty or literal `{{1}}` values. Confirm the template's placeholders with `journeys_message_templates`, then bind each one.

**Use the right path.** A binding value is a dot-path, and it must be one the send-time resolver can reach. Call **`journeys_message_variables`** for the exact set this journey offers, then copy a returned `path` verbatim. The paths fall into three families:

| Family | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `customer.<field>` | Built-in contact fields | `customer.name`, `customer.phoneNumber` |
| `person.<key>` | **Custom person attributes** (from people upsert / your CDP) | `person.bank`, `person.plan` |
| run-produced values | Answers extracted in the conversation, or event/segment data carried into the run | copy the exact `path` from `journeys_message_variables` |

So a binding is **not** always `person.*` — built-in fields are `customer.*`, and extracted/event/segment data has its own paths that `journeys_message_variables` returns.

> ⚠️ A custom person attribute is `person.<key>` (e.g. `person.bank`) — **not** `attributes.bank` and **not** `customer.attributes.bank`. `attributes.<key>` is the DECISION/CASE **condition** syntax (from `journeys_condition_catalog`); it does not resolve in a message binding and the message will arrive blank. `journeys_validate` now rejects such a binding before publish.

## Publish-time validation

`journeys_validate` checks dozens of rules; the ones that trip people up most:

- Exactly **one ENTRY**, at least **one EXIT**; unique node ids; every edge references existing nodes; every node named.
- One out-edge per `(node, signal)` — a handle may wire to **at most one** node (no fan-out), and no signal may be left unwired. `WAIT_FOR_REPLY` needs both `REPLIED` and `TIMEOUT`; `MANAGE_CONVERSATION` needs `CLOSED`; `DECISION` needs both `YES` and `NO`; `CASE` needs every branch **plus** `case:default`; `HTTP_REQUEST` needs both `SUCCESS` and `FAILED`.
- `SEND_MESSAGE`: `templateId` and `channelId` both set — there is no silent fallback number.
- Timeouts and durations use the `30m` / `24h` / `3d` format; DELAY `until_date` must be in the future; DELAY timezones must be valid IANA zones.
- Foot-gun warnings: a `DISPATCH_EVENT` emitting the same event the ENTRY listens to (self-trigger loop), or an event that both enrolls and cancels the run.

Drafts can be incomplete; only **publish** requires a clean validation.

## Proven topologies (from production)

**1. Single outbound + conversation** (the simplest shape):
```
ENTRY ─SENT→ SEND_MESSAGE ─SENT→ WAIT_FOR_REPLY ─REPLIED→ MANAGE_CONVERSATION ─CLOSED→ EXIT(done)
                                        └─TIMEOUT→ EXIT(no_response)              └─STALE→ EXIT(stalled)
```

**2. Open the send window before the first message** (use this on almost every outbound flow):
```
ENTRY ─SENT→ DELAY(until_weekday: Mon–Fri, 10:00–11:00) ─SENT→ SEND_MESSAGE(round 1) ─SENT→ …
```
Enrollment and outreach become two separate decisions. You can load the whole audience whenever it suits you (the night before, in pieces, while templates are still in review) and everyone parks at the gate until the window opens, instead of getting messaged the moment they land. A run that reaches this node while the window is already open continues immediately, so it costs nothing when you enroll during business hours.

`DELAY` in `until_weekday` mode takes `weekdays` (ISO, 1=Mon), `windowStartMinutes`/`windowEndMinutes` (minutes past local midnight, so 600–660 is 10:00–11:00), and an optional IANA `timezone` that **defaults to the organization's timezone** — set it explicitly when the audience isn't in the org's home timezone. If a run becomes eligible after the window closed, it waits for the next allowed weekday rather than sending late.

Prefer a **generous window** over a tight one. A one-hour window means any queue drift pushes the send a full day; a 9:00–18:00 window sends the same morning and only slips to the next day if it genuinely has to.

**3. Multi-round follow-up** (re-contact non-responders). **How you space the rounds depends on whether the campaign runs once or forever, and getting this wrong silently double-messages people.**

The rule behind it: a `DELAY` is a **pure wait — it does not race an incoming reply**. Someone who answers while parked on a `DELAY` still gets answered by the AI (that pipeline is independent of the journey), but the graph never learns about it, so the next round fires anyway. Only `WAIT_FOR_REPLY` and `MANAGE_CONVERSATION` listen.

*One-time campaigns* (research, win-back, a single cohort) — put the **whole gap inside `WAIT_FOR_REPLY`** so every hour between rounds is connected to an agent block:
```
… SEND_MESSAGE(r1) ─SENT→ WAIT_FOR_REPLY(6h) ─TIMEOUT→ SEND_MESSAGE(r2) ─SENT→ WAIT_FOR_REPLY(20h) ─TIMEOUT→ SEND_MESSAGE(r3) → …
                                  └─REPLIED→ MANAGE_CONVERSATION ─CLOSED→ EXIT
```
Size each timeout to the real clock gap you want: a 10:00 opener, a 16:00 nudge and a next-day-noon last touch is `6h` then `20h`. No `DELAY` between rounds at all.

*Recurring campaigns* — you can't do that, because you need a `DELAY` to place the next send in an acceptable window (an audience that hits round 2 on a Friday evening should not be messaged on Saturday). So give `WAIT_FOR_REPLY` **enough time to actually catch a reply, six to eight hours minimum**, and only then hand off to the `DELAY` that carries the run into the next window:
```
… SEND_MESSAGE(r1) ─SENT→ WAIT_FOR_REPLY(8h) ─TIMEOUT→ DELAY(until_weekday, next window) ─SENT→ SEND_MESSAGE(r2) → …
                                  └─REPLIED→ MANAGE_CONVERSATION ─CLOSED→ EXIT
```
The residual risk is real but bounded: someone replying during that `DELAY` gets a follow-up they didn't need. Shrinking the `DELAY` doesn't fix it, lengthening the `WAIT_FOR_REPLY` does.

Each round needs its own approved follow-up template.

**4. Attribute-personalized opener** (branch before sending):
```
ENTRY ─SENT→ CASE(attributes.plan) ─case:pro→ SEND_MESSAGE(template_pro) ─┐
                       ├─case:basic→ SEND_MESSAGE(template_basic) ────────┼→ WAIT_FOR_REPLY → …
                       └─case:default→ SEND_MESSAGE(template_generic) ────┘
```
Use CASE for a **small** fork on a single attribute (plan, language, party size). For anything bigger, don't cram multiple goals into one journey — see "One objective per initiative".

**5. Always-on, segment-triggered**:
```
ENTRY(segment: "churned last month", maxEnrollments 1 per 90d) ─SENT→ …
```
People entering the segment enroll automatically; the frequency cap prevents re-contacting the same person too often. Pair with `isRecurring` + `reportCadence` on the initiative.

An `ENTRY` can also be `cdp_event`-triggered, which lets your own system decide the moment someone starts. **Know the tradeoff before you reach for it on a list you already have:** an event-triggered enrollment carries only the event's own `properties`, and it never fills in the per-participant context that enrolling from a list does, so any field you were counting on won't be there unless you put it in the event payload yourself. When the audience arrives as a spreadsheet, uploading it through the CSV flow (or `initiatives_participants_add`) is the better choice, because that path carries the columns through. Reach for the event trigger when the *timing* genuinely belongs to your system, not as a way to stage a list. Pattern 2 already gives you staging without giving up per-participant data.

**6. Call an external system, then hand off** (chaining):
```
… MANAGE_CONVERSATION ─CLOSED→ HTTP_REQUEST(POST the collected data to your API) ─SUCCESS→ DISPATCH_EVENT(done) ─SENT→ EXIT(nextInitiativeId: next)
                                                                                  └─FAILED→ EXIT(needs_review)
```
`HTTP_REQUEST` posts to your endpoint (authenticated with a stored credential) and its response is available to later nodes; `EXIT.nextInitiativeId` chains the person into a follow-on initiative. This is how you keep each initiative focused on one job and pass the baton between them.

## One objective per initiative

An initiative's conversation is run by the AI toward the **single objective** you set on the initiative. Journeys are great at *routing* (branch, wait, call an API, hand off), but a journey should not try to make one conversation accomplish two different goals — the agent handles a focused objective far better than a split one. When a flow really has two jobs (e.g. "collect the documents" and then, later, "resolve what was wrong with them"), model them as **two initiatives chained by an event or an `EXIT.nextInitiativeId`**, not one journey with a mode switch.

To keep a person out of two conflicting initiatives at once, two mechanisms help: a `DECISION` guard right before an action (re-check the person's current status; exit if they've moved on), and journey-level `cancelOnEvents` (cancel an in-flight run when a status event arrives). Pick whichever fits — the guard is explicit and easy to reason about.

## Design review checklist

Before publishing (or handing over a spec), verify:
1. Every `WAIT_FOR_REPLY` / `MANAGE_CONVERSATION` / `DECISION` / `CASE` / `HTTP_REQUEST` has **all** its signals wired (the TIMEOUT / FAILED paths are the ones people forget).
2. Every `SEND_MESSAGE` names an **APPROVED** template and a channel id, and **binds every template placeholder** (`templateBindings`). Check the approval status yourself before you save — a clean `journeys_validate` is not a promise that every template is ready to send.
3. Follow-up templates exist for every round (round 2..N need their own approved template).
4. DELAY windows respect the audience's waking hours, and the `timezone` is right — it falls back to the **organization's** timezone, which is not always the audience's. Set it explicitly when they differ.
5. Segment-triggered ENTRY has a frequency cap unless the user explicitly wants unlimited re-enrollment.
6. EXIT `outcome` labels are meaningful (`recovered`, `no_response`) — they show up in analysis.

## Debugging a live journey

`journeys_get_definition` returns the full graph; `initiatives_get` shows the published version pointer. Typical diagnoses:
- **"Second message never sent"** → the `TIMEOUT` edge is missing on the wait node, or the follow-up template is not APPROVED.
- **"Message arrived with blank / `{{1}}` values"** → `templateBindings` is missing on the SEND_MESSAGE node, **or** a binding uses a path the resolver can't reach (e.g. `attributes.bank` / `customer.attributes.bank` instead of `person.bank`). Check each binding against `journeys_message_variables`; `journeys_validate` flags an unresolvable path.
- **"Some people got nothing"** → a CASE value with no matching branch falling to an unwired default, or Do Not Contact suppression (expected, server-side).
- **"Person enrolled twice"** → segment-triggered ENTRY without `maxEnrollments` / `enrollmentWindow`.
